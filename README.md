# Game of Thrones Trivia

### Overview
A Game of Thrones trivia game that uses Javascript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate the HTML.

### Why I chose my  theme? 
I wanted something fun and a theme that many people would know the answers to. Also, its Game of Thrones!

--------

### How I built it:
* I started with some very basic pseudo code of what I wanted it to do. I knew I wanted the javascript file to select 10 questions from an array of questions and then randomize their order in a new array.
* From there, it was a matter of displaying the questions and choices, comparing the selected choice to the answer, logging if it was correct or not, and showing a gif with whether or not it was correct.
* I also wanted to add a timer so that the user only has so much time to pick an answer and I wanted to use a timeout to display the correct answer before moving on to display the next answer
* Finally I wanted to show the user the number they got correct and incorrect with an option to reset the game which would select 10 new questions, randomize the order, and start over.
* With the pseudo coing all done, I proceeded to build my game out with Javascript logic and jQuery for HTML manipulation.
* All in all I ended up with what I considered a pretty solid trivia game.

### Future changes I would still like to make:
* I would like to clean up the css to make the game look better and be more responsive in general.
* I would like to dive into the facebook API to turn the game into one of those `share on facebook` games where it would post to the user's facebook with a link to the game.
